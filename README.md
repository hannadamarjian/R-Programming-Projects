# R-Programming-Projects
This repository incorporates all of my R projects/code.

# Predictive Analytics Projects:
Australian Rainfall and Airbnb Pricing on New York residences were machine learning projects I completed. 
Australian Rainfall was a classification problem whereas Airbnb was a regression problem. A report for each is included in 
this repository.

# Survival Analysis Project:
This project required proving two theorems that were summarized in a research paper for two competing risk factors (such that one was the leading cause of death for N patients). 
I incorporated a Beamer presentation a paper that illustrated my proofs/arguments for the theorems, and shared the data analysis portion.

# Databases and SQL Project:
I created a Beamer presentation and included my LaTeX/R code to explain the gist of databases, database management systems, relational vs. non-relational databases, and SQL queries were done on R Studio using mysql() package.
